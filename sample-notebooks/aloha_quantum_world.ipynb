    "'Hello, World!' has been the most iconic computer program. There is a good chance that you, our reader, also began your journey in the world of programming by printing 'Hello, World!' on your screen. In this article, we aim to develop a quantum version of the 'Hello, World!' program that we call 'Aloha, Quantum World!'. Before we do that, let us discuss the significance of the traditional \"Hello, World!\" program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hello world program was developed by Brian Kernighan, in 1974. Its purpose was to be\n",
    "- the simplest possible program for the language\n",
    "- a demonstration of the syntax for a particular language \n",
    "- and to check everything is working correctly. Remember these were the days when people were still figuring out how to connect a display device to a computer. So, the program also checked if the program compiled correctly and if the connection to the input and output devices (such as a monitor) is not erring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the reasoning behind the classical 'Hello, World!', let us discuss what we would want to accomplish with quantum 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "- Similar to 'Hello, World!' we would want it to be the simplest quantum program. And, our version of quantum 'Hello, World!' is called 'Aloha, World!'.\n",
    "- 'Aloha, World!' should go through the quantum software and hardware layer to ensure the faithfulness of the stack.\n",
    "- Then, we want to go one step further. If you look into the details of 'Aloha, World!', it should present to you the details for how quantum computing is fundamentally different than classical computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few more comments about the state of quantum computers now compared to the state of classical computers when the 'Hello, World!' was developed. \n",
    "- The number of transistors in a microprocessor were in a few thousands in 1970s compared to a few ten's of qubits available in quantum computers currently.\n",
    "- People were starting develop high level languages for programming classical computers. 'Hello, World!' was first reference in 'B' a predecessor to the language 'C'. In comparison, most quantum computers are being programmed using python. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let us present to you the 'Aloha, Quantum World!' program. The function is called using the following piece of code:"

    "Just like the classical 'Hello, World!' program, it is a simple program. If it is called without input, it always outputs 'Hello, World!'. But, if 'quantum' is passed as input then, it sometimes outputs the 'Hello, World!' and other times it outputs 'Bye, World!'. This is the reason why we thought naming this article 'Aloha, Quantum World!' was apt. If ran enough number of times, one will observe that the program in-fact prints 'Hello, World!' and 'Bye, World!' 50% of the time. We encourage you to play with the code to convince yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you may ponder as to what may be going on behind the scenes in the program. Since the program seems to be printing 'Hello, World!' and 'Bye, World!' with 50% probability, your initial guess maybe that it is similar to a coin flip, And yes, it is similar but not quite! First, note that in the macroscopic world for which we have built our intuition, probability arises out of incomplete knowledge of a given system. e.g. in the case of a coin flip, if all the parameters for the coin flip are known, like the force with which it was flipped, the exact force of gravity, friction due to air, etc. then theoretically it will be possible to predict whether it will turn up heads or tails. But, because you don't know these parameters, the best you can do is predict with some probabilities. Again, I want you to appreciate that in the  classical world probabilities arise out of not knowing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important detail to note is that when the coin lands on the ground, it lands on either heads or tails. Let us say that you toss a coin in a dark room where you can't see whether the heads or tails have turned up. Even before you turn on the light to look, you can be sure that it is either heads or tails, it cannot be both at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program `aloha_quantum_world('quantum')` that we ran above is non-compliant with the two points that we just mentioned. The program uses a qubit or quantum bit in a 'superposition' of being '0' and '1'. \n",
    "Qubit is a quantum analog of a bit. A qubit could behave like a bit but also allows for more exotic behavior.\n",
    "Quantum Superposition, in very simple terms, is the property of quantum systems which allow them to be in two distinct states at the same time. When measured, the qubit returns, either 0 or 1. \n",
    "Corresponding to the two points we mentioned for a coin, note the following points for a qubit in superposition:\n",
    "First, even with complete knowledge of the state of a qubit, knowing everything that there is to be known for a state of a qubit, we will still not be able to predict the outcome. In fact, the universe itself does not 'know' whether the qubit will return 0 or 1 when measured. The probability in quantum systems does not arise from 'not knowing' but is actually built into the fabric of nature.\n",
    "Second, the qubit in the state of equal superposition of '0' and '1', is not like a coin lying on the ground in a dark room where it is one of those but we just don't know, but it is both '0' and '1' at the same time!!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is understandable if you are shaking your head in disbelief and asking yourself, 'How could this be?'. You are not alone in asking this question and the answer is: 'It is just the way nature is, and quantum mechanics is a theory based on observations.'. To learn more about quantum computation, we invite you to take our [QuBes Course](./Qubes_course/0_Introduction.ipynb) (quantum beginners) course on qBraid.com. We introduce all the background material and teach you quantum computing. The background material will cover the experiments that convinced physicist that,\n",
    "nature is probabilistic, and\n",
    "a qubit in superposition is both '0' and '1' at the same time. The superposition of a qubit could be leveraged to make quantum algorithms faster than their classical counterparts. One such algorithm covered in QuBes course is Deutsch's algorithm. You will be able to run the algorithm on IBM's actual quantum computer to see it in action!"
